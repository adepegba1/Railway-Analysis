# üöÜ Railway Ticket Sales & Delay Analysis

## üìò Introduction
This project analyzes data from a railway ticketing system to uncover insights into customer purchasing behavior, route popularity, ticket pricing trends, and journey delays. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn), the analysis explores patterns that can inform business decisions and improve operational efficiency.

- The key objectives of this project were:

  - To identify top-performing routes and revenue sources.  
  - To evaluate purchasing behavior (online vs station sales).  
  - To analyze delay causes and their relationship to refunds.  
  - To understand ticket price variations by class and type.  
  - To discover time- and season-based trends in sales and delays.
